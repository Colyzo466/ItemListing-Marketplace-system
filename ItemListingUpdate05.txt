6. Security:
   - Implement basic security measures, such as authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.


Update details:
This code is a Solidity smart contract that implements a simple marketplace system where users can list items
for sale, purchase items, edit or delete items, and generate sales reports or purchase history.

Below are the key points explained in detail:

1. **MarketplaceReports Library**:
    - Defines two structs `SalesReport` and `PurchaseHistory` to hold information about sales and purchase history.
    - Contains two functions `generateSalesReport` and `generatePurchaseHistory` to generate sales reports and purchase
      history respectively. These functions use the `ItemListing` contract to fetch item details and create reports.

2. **Ownable Contract**:
    - Contains a simple `owner` implementation to restrict certain functions to be accessed only by the owner of the contract.
    - Provides a modifier `isOwner` to check if the caller is the owner before executing certain functions.

3. **ItemListing Contract**:
    - Inherits from `Ownable` contract.
    - Defines a struct `Item` to represent an item with name, description, price, and quantity.
    - Events are emitted for listing items, editing items, deleting items, and purchasing items.
    - Constructor sets the `listingFee` for listing items.
    - Functions include:
        - `listItem`: Allows a user to list an item for sale by paying the listing fee.
        - `editItem`: Allows the owner to edit the details of an item based on the item ID.
        - `deleteItem`: Allows the owner to delete an item based on the item ID.
        - `purchaseItem`: Allows a user to purchase an item by sending the required amount.
        - `getSellerItemCount` and `getItemDetails`: Helper functions to get item count and details for a specific seller.
        - `generateSalesReport` and `generatePurchaseHistory`: Public functions that call the respective functions 
           from the `MarketplaceReports` library.

4. **Usage of Libraries and Structs**:
    - It shows how libraries and structs can be used in Solidity contracts for code organization and reusability.
    - `MarketplaceReports` library is used to generate sales reports and purchase history within the `ItemListing` contract.

5. **Modifiers and Access Control**:
    - It demonstrates the use of modifiers (`isOwner`) to control access to certain functions based on predefined conditions.

In summary, this code showcases the implementation of a marketplace system in Solidity using libraries, structs, events, modifiers, and
access control mechanisms. It allows users to list items, edit or delete items, purchase items, and view sales reports or purchase history.
