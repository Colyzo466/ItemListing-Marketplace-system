    - Deploy the `ItemListing` contract on a supported Ethereum network (like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or a local development network) using a tool such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
    - Add the necessary parameters, such as the listing fee when deploying the contract.
    - Make sure to fund the contract owner address with some Ether to cover gas costs for transactions.

2. **Interaction**:
    - Use a Web3 provider like MetaMask or use a tool like Remix to interact with the deployed contract.
    - Use the provided functions like `listItem`, `editItem`, `deleteItem`, `purchaseItem`, `generateSalesReport`, and `generatePurchaseHistory` to interact with the marketplace syste
